# Contributing to Sekai Viewer
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Welcome All Kinds of Code Changes Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo.
2. ~~If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. (Not yet)~~
3. ~~Ensure the test suite passes. (Not yet)~~
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Format you code with `prettier`.
6. Commit message with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Sekai-World/sekai-viewer/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Sekai-World/sekai-viewer/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
It's very simple:

- use camelCase
- format with `prettier`
- use meaningful variable name
- comment on the "strange"-looking but intentional codes

## License
